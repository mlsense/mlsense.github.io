      <description>Repetitive tasks should be done using as many shortcuts as possible. You are not doing anything new and hence not even an extra minute should be spent on doing the same. This post refers to the shortcuts that come in handy when working on the vi/vim editor.
This is not an exhaustive list. These are the ones I use frequently. Feel free to comment down your favorite shortcuts. Navigation keys  0 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Moves cursor to the start of the line $ &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Moves cursor to the end of the line w &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Moves forward one word b &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Moves backward one word</description>

      <description> Hello world,
I am trying to create a site using Hugo static site generator. This is a markdown page.
Trying color syntaxing using pygmentize import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlip.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns # Add comment here  Using hugo syntax highlight # Loading required packages import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlip.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns </description>

      <title>Time series and forecasting using R</title>

      <description>Time series forecasting is a skill that few people claim to know. Machine learning is cool. And there are a lot of people interested in becoming a machine learning expert. But forecasting is something that is a little domain specific. Retailers like Walmart, Target use forecasting systems and tools to replenish their products in the stores. An excellent forecast system helps in winning the other pipelines of the supply chain.</description>

      <description>There are two ways in which we can collect data for building recommender systems — explicit and implicit. In this post, we will talk about both types of data, their characteristics and the challenges with them. Explicit feedback datasets The dictionary meaning of explicit is to state clearly and in detail. Explicit feedback data as the name suggests is an exact number given by a user to a product. Some of the examples of explicit feedback are ratings of movies by users on Netflix, ratings of products by users on Amazon.</description>

      <description>A little fun fact. The image that you see in this post was drawn by Professor Adele Cutler&amp;rsquo;s son. Professor Adele is has worked very closely with Prof. Breiman on Random forest. Prof. Breiman wanted a simple photo that captured the essence of simplicity and comprehensiveness of Random forest algorithm. Let us get started. Random Forests algorithm has always fascinated me. I like how this algorithm can be easily explained to anyone without much hassle.</description>

      <description>There are two ways one can write the code to train a random forest model in R. Both the ways are listed below. A normal and frequent way of writing the command to train the random forest model is something like this. rfModel &amp;lt;- randomForest(Survived~. , data = trainSample[, -c(6, 8, 9)])  Notice the ~ sign. We call this the formula way of writing. Another way of writing the command to train the random forest model is shown below.</description>

      <description>I recently tried installing caret package in R using install.packages(&amp;lsquo;caret&amp;rsquo;, dependencies=T) 
Normally this installation of package works and I continue to work with the functions associated with the package. When I tried including the package using library(caret) 
I got the following error.
Error in loadNamespace(j  R was not able to install this dependency package- pbkrtest. So I tried installing it separately, again using install.package(&amp;lsquo;pbkrtest&amp;rsquo;, dependencies=T)</description>

      <description>I am no expert of shell commands. I have been using them for quite some time and thought I give an attempt to list down the most common commands. I am writing these mostly from the perspective of a data-science guy. Let us get started. I will use the file- ‘data.txt’ to illustrate these commands. ‘data.txt’ is a file having 200 rows and 8 columns. You can access the data here.</description>

      <description>Confession time I don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad to confess this that ROC curve, AUC, True-positive and related terms took quite some time for me to understand. If today I contemplate on the reasons why I found this topic confusing. The first would be there are not many resources that explains intuitively what these mean. They just jump to the terms and the mathematical formula for them. The second being I had not used them even in my project work.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, I had written a post on The Big Data Problem{:target=&amp;rdquo;_blank&amp;rdquo;} which attempted to understand why we need big data and what the fuss is all about. You may want to read it here{:target=&amp;rdquo;_blank&amp;rdquo;}. Having understood why we need big data, let’s understand how we can go about analyzing the same. What is the way out to do analysis on big data? The solution is Streaming…Hadoop Streaming.</description>

      <title>When R package is not available across the cluster</title>

      <description>When deploying R codes across the cluster, many a times the reason for the failure of the task is unavailability of a particular package across all nodes of the cluster. We wait for someone to get the package installed across all the nodes. This may take some days. Do we wait for them? Naah! Presenting a temporary solution that one of my colleague came up with. I have used this technique and this works smoothly.</description>

      <description>Big data has become a sensation these days. Anyone and everyone wants to use this in their discussions. When I was still in my college and preparing for campus placements, I had attended almost all the pre-placement talks that companies gave to its prospective candidates. American Express was one such company that had talked extensively about big data and hadoop in their presentation. I remember clearly, the blank faces that all of us had.</description>

Keywords: date, datetime, python, tutorial, manish barnwal
I cringe every time I see a date type column in the data. And you may ask why so? Date columns need some methods applied to them
The reason is I don&amp;rsquo;t normally see date columns in the data I work with so I don&amp;rsquo;t remember the functions and methods that work on dates to get meaningful columns out of the date column in the data.</description>
