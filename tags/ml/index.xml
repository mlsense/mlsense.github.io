      <description>Time series forecasting is a skill that few people claim to know. Machine learning is cool. And there are a lot of people interested in becoming a machine learning expert. But forecasting is something that is a little domain specific. Retailers like Walmart, Target use forecasting systems and tools to replenish their products in the stores. An excellent forecast system helps in winning the other pipelines of the supply chain.</description>

      <description>A little fun fact. The image that you see in this post was drawn by Professor Adele Cutler&amp;rsquo;s son. Professor Adele is has worked very closely with Prof. Breiman on Random forest. Prof. Breiman wanted a simple photo that captured the essence of simplicity and comprehensiveness of Random forest algorithm. Let us get started. Random Forests algorithm has always fascinated me. I like how this algorithm can be easily explained to anyone without much hassle.</description>

      <title>ROC and AUC - The three lettered acronyms</title>

      <description>Confession time I don&amp;rsquo;t feel bad to confess this that ROC curve, AUC, True-positive and related terms took quite some time for me to understand. If today I contemplate on the reasons why I found this topic confusing. The first would be there are not many resources that explains intuitively what these mean. They just jump to the terms and the mathematical formula for them. The second being I had not used them even in my project work.</description>
