      <description>R is the most used tool in data science. It has no dearth of packages for specific use cases. There are three packages that I feel can get your most of the work done - ggplot2, dplyr, data.table.  ggplot2- Used for visualization. Also known as grammar of graphics. This package is used to plot graphs. The syntax is intuitive and easy to learn.
 dplyr- Used for data manipulation.</description>

      <description>When deploying R codes across the cluster, many a times the reason for the failure of the task is unavailability of a particular package across all nodes of the cluster. We wait for someone to get the package installed across all the nodes. This may take some days. Do we wait for them? Naah! Presenting a temporary solution that one of my colleague came up with. I have used this technique and this works smoothly.</description>
