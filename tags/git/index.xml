      <description>Personal realisation It has been close to a year since I shifted to a start-up which incidentally got acquired after a month of my joining. Before this I used to work at WalmartLabs where we always wanted to use a version control system like git but it never took off properly. Now that I am working in this start-up I got to know that just taking a course on git/github doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you a master of this topic.</description>
